Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

A data type is a way to tell a computer what kind of data you are working with, so it knows how to process it. Think of it as a "label" for your data. For example, a number, a letter, or a list of items can all be stored as different types of data.

Types of Data Types

Primitive Data Types
Non-Primitive Data Types

-----
1.Primitive data type-non-mutable,built-in,single value
-string
sequence of characters enclosed within "",'',``(template literals/backtiks)
typeof(identifier)-to recheck

-number
range=-2^53-1 to ++2^53-1
beyond this range datatype is bigint

-Boolean
true/false

-undefined
declared but not initialized

-null
acceptable empty value,absence of an object
typeof() return object

-symbol

-bigint
any valye suffix with "n" is bigint
eg:2n

2.Non-primitive data types-mutable,user-defined,multiple values
-objects(math,date,json)
-arrays
-functions
